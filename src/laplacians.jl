"""
    compute_laplacian(W::AbstractMatrix, ::RandomWalkLaplacian)

Compute the random-walk normalized graph Laplacian from an affinity matrix `W`.

The random-walk normalized Laplacian is defined as

    L_rw = I - D⁻¹W

where `W` is the affinity matrix and `D` is the degree matrix.

This implementation is based on the normalized cuts formulation by Shi and Malik.
Their paper formulates the problem as the generalized eigenvalue problem

    (D - W)y = λDy

with

    L = D - W

Multiplying both sides by `D⁻¹` gives

    D⁻¹(D - W)y = λy

and therefore

    (I - D⁻¹W)y = λy

# Arguments
- `W`: Square symmetric affinity matrix. Entry `W[i, j]` stores the similarity between samples `i` and `j`.
- `::RandomWalkLaplacian`: Selects the random-walk normalized Laplacian.

# Returns
The random-walk normalized Laplacian matrix `L_rw`.

# Throws
- `ArgumentError` if `W` is not square.
- `ArgumentError` if `W` is not symmetric.
- `ArgumentError` if `W` contains negative affinity values.
- `ArgumentError` if at least one node has degree zero.
